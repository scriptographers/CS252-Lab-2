MTU stands for \textbf{Maximum Transmission Unit}, which defines the size of the largest protocol data unit (PDU) that can be communicated in a single network layer (layer-3) transaction. It is specified in terms of \textbf{bytes} or octets of the largest PDU that the layer can pass onwards. \footnote{Source:  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit}{Wikipedia} }

The destination IP addresses changes when the source changes, even if the domain name is the same.

\smallskip

In fact, it even changes with time keeping the source and the destination fixed.\\ 
For example, when \texttt{traceroute} was run again from the local machine, $\approx 10$ mins later, the destination IP address changed from \texttt{216.58.203.36} to \texttt{142.250.76.164} (also Mumbai) and then after $\approx 5$ mins, it reverted back to \texttt{216.58.203.36}, and then it changed to \texttt{216.58.200.196} (Zhengzhou, China), approximately $2$ mins later.

This is because when a client attempts to connect to Google, several DNS servers resolve \texttt{www.google.com} into multiple IP addresses via \textbf{Round Robin policy}. This acts as the first level of load balancing and directs the client to different Google cluster, which has thousands of server. \footnote{Reference: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_data_centers}}

All the destination IP are located in San Francisco, irrespective of the source. \\
CNN is headquartered in US and one possible explanation of the above observation is that CNN uses a cluster of servers located at the same location (facility) for service.

All the destination IP Addresses are same for the same url \texttt{www.iitd.ac.in}, irrespective of the source. 
Also, for, say \texttt{www.cse.iitd.ac.in}, the IP address responding is always \texttt{103.27.9.152}, 
irrespective of source. Location for all servers was New Delhi, probably some Computer-Center in the institute.

This points towards a possibility that IIT-Delhi has designated a certain server
for responding to a specific url, like, the server with IP \texttt{103.27.9.24} will 
respond to requests for \texttt{www.iitd.ac.in}; while the server with IP 
\texttt{103.27.9.152} will respond to requests for \texttt{www.cse.iitd.ac.in}. 

\newpage
\subsection*{Destination: \texttt{iitb.ac.in}}

When we tried performing \texttt{traceroute} for \texttt{www.iitb.ac.in} 
[and other iitb urls], it reveals the destination IP address (located in Powai) but the traceroute never reaches that.\\
The last IP address detected (for all sources), 
was \texttt{115.110.234.170}, identified with Tata Communications Limited. After this, we only received \texttt{* * *} as the output.\\
This is most probably becuase the IITB network system is blanketed with a VPN.

\smallskip
After connecting to the IITB-VPN, the traceroute instantly reaches the private IP for \texttt{iitb.ac.in} in a single hop.\\
Interestingly, (when on IITB-VPN) the route to most other addresses (including \texttt{www.google.com}) passes 
through \texttt{vpn4profsoumen.iitb.ac.in}

    \caption{Source: O. Krajsa and L. Fojtova, ``RTT measurement and its dependence on the real geographical distance"}
    \label{fig:rtt_vs_dist}
\end{figure}

We observe that the RTT does somewhat increase with increase in the geographical distance.\\
%However, since the transmitted ``signal" (being an electromagnetic wave) travels at the speed of light,  
%The time for travelling geographical distance (on the wire) is really low, as compared to, say, 
The time delay caused by the number of routers the signal has to travel through, server response time, the network traffic, etc. also affects the RTT. \footnote{Reference:
\url{https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cdn/glossary/round-trip-time-rtt/}}\\
A much more extensive analysis was performed by O. Krajsa and L. Fojtova \footnote{O. Krajsa and L. Fojtova, ``RTT measurement and its dependence on the real geographical distance", 2011 34th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP), Budapest, 2011, pp. 231-234, doi: 10.1109/TSP.2011.6043737.} who claimed that the dependence of RTT on the geographical distance can be for some cases considered as a linear function.

% There is a loose ``direct proportion" relationship between geographical distance and the RTT.
% However, since the transmitted ``signal" (being an electromagnetic wave)
% travels at the speed of light, %(which is extremely fast even in non-vacuum media), 
% the time for travelling geographical distance (on the wire) is really low, 
% as compared to, say, the time delay caused by the number of routers the
% signal has to travel through, server response time, the network traffic, etc., the latter dominates.\footnote{Reference used:
% \url{https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cdn/glossary/round-trip-time-rtt/}}

\subsubsection*{Dependence on the Country}
We also observe that less developed countries (like Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Nepal, etc) have much higher RTTs than the developed ones.\\ 
For a contrasting example, the RTT to Nepal was about \texttt{301.342 ms} while the RTT to Australia (which is much further geographically) was only \texttt{24.133 ms}

\subsection*{Errors}

We were often getting the following errors while running \texttt{iperf}/\texttt{iperf3}:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0.5ex]

    \item \texttt{iperf3: error - the server is busy running a test. try again later}\\
    Changing the port number using \texttt{-p} flag sometimes seemed to resolve this issue.\\
    Sometimes, running \texttt{iperf} instead of \texttt{iperf3} resolved this issue.
    
    \item \texttt{connect failed: No route to host}\\
    This was observed while using \texttt{iperf}, couldn't find any fix for this, the same server worked using \texttt{iperf3} though
    
    \item \texttt{iperf3: error - unable to connect to server: Connection refused}\\
    Got this error when trying to use different ports
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusions: }

In both the cases for all team members, it was a common observation that the UDP rates are higher than the TCP ones.

\textbf{Expected reason:} As observed, UDP is much faster than TCP. This may be because TCP does retransmission of packet losses and congestion control, whereas UDP does not do either. There is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection in UDP, whereas TCP requires this \footnote{\url{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/}}. Although UDP is faster, TCP is more ``reliable" due to the same reasons listed above. Thus, there seems to be a tradeoff between ``reliability" and speed.
