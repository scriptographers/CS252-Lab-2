MTU stands for \textbf{Maximum Transmission Unit}, which defines the size of the largest protocol data unit (PDU) that can be communicated in a single network layer (layer-3) transaction. It is specified in terms of \textbf{bytes} or octets of the largest PDU that the layer can pass onwards. \footnote{Source:  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit}{Wikipedia} }

The destination IP addresses changes when the source changes, even if the domain name is the same.

\smallskip

In fact, it even changes with time keeping the source and the destination fixed.\\ 
For example, when \texttt{traceroute} was run again from the local machine, $\approx 10$ mins later, the destination IP address changed from \texttt{216.58.203.36} to \texttt{142.250.76.164} (also Mumbai) and then after $\approx 5$ mins, it reverted back to \texttt{216.58.203.36}, and then it changed to \texttt{216.58.200.196} (Zhengzhou, China), approximately $2$ mins later.

\smallskip

This is because when a client attempts to connect to Google, several DNS servers resolve \texttt{www.google.com} into multiple IP addresses via \textbf{Round Robin policy}. This acts as the first level of load balancing and directs the client to different Google cluster, which has thousands of server. \footnote{Reference: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_data_centers}}

The ``Sender" is the client, the value mentioned is the upload speed from the client to the \texttt{iperf} server.\\
The ``Receiver" is \texttt{iperf} server, the value mentioned is the download speed on \texttt{iperf} server for the client.\footnote{Reference: \url{https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/480#issuecomment-307205313}}

I was often getting the following errors while trying to run \texttt{iperf}/\texttt{iperf3}:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0.5ex]

    \item \texttt{iperf3: error - the server is busy running a test. try again later}\\
    Changing the port number using \texttt{-p} flag sometimes seemed to resolve this issue.\\
    Sometimes, running \texttt{iperf} instead of \texttt{iperf3} resolved this issue.
    
    \item \texttt{connect failed: No route to host}\\
    This was observed while using \texttt{iperf}, couldn't find any fix for this, the same server worked using \texttt{iperf3} though
    
    \item \texttt{iperf3: error - unable to connect to server: Connection refused}\\
    Got this error when trying to use different ports
